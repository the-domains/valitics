Sometimes, work is boring. You might need a distraction from whatever routine task you're doing on your Mac, like entering data into a spreadsheet or replying to email. **Netflix** is a great idea, but you have to portion your screen or move windows around in order to both watch a show on Netflix as well as get your work done.

Not anymore, though, as [NEnhancer][0] lets you use the magical power of Chrome to get a Netflix movie or TV show in a small window that will float on top of any other apps you're running, making sure your Netflix video running in the foreground on your Mac.

Just be sure to actually get your work finished, too.
